This book is an adaptation of a series of lectures given by Dr Daniel Chalk as part of the HSMA programme. All lectures and accompanying code examples and exercises were written by Dr Daniel Chalk and made available under the **C BY-NC-SA 4.0** licence. The chapters often replicate the wording of these lectures nearly exactly, with minor tweaks and additions for readability and to better suit the format of a book made by Sammi Rosser.
