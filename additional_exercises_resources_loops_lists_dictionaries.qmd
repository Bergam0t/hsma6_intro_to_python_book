# Additional Exercises and Resources - Loops, Lists and Dictionaries

## Coding Notebooks

[Dr Pawel Orzechowski](https://github.com/drpawelo) of the University of Edinburgh has made a range of programming exercises freely available.

You can visit his Code Storytelling website [here](http://www.codestorytelling.com/) to watch some additional videos that go with these exercises.

## Sololearn

There is a course on Sololearn called ['Introduction to Python'](https://www.sololearn.com/en/learn/courses/python-introduction).

This has some interactive code exercises that build up more gradually.
You do have to sign up for a free account - but you don't need to sign up for the pro trial or a pro account to access 90% of that particular course.

There is also an app version of this site for your phone/tablet so you can fit in practice on the go or whenever you have a spare moment.
