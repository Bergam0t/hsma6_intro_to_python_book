It is now the most widely used language in the world.\nA key feature of Python is that it is highly extensible. This means we can bring in code that others have written to extend the core functionality of Python (we saw that in the last session when we talked about packages).\nPython also allows us to get quick results and build iteratively making it perfect for scientific computing (such as modelling and data science).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYes - it really is named after British comedy troupe Monty Python!",

We said that they are bundles of code that we can run every time we call them. We can give them optional inputs, and may get some outputs.\nTo write text to the screen in Python, we use something known as the print() function. The input (that we put in the brackets) is the thing we want it to write to the screen.\nLet’s try it!\nWe use quotation marks “ to denote a string (ie text - a series of characters).

    "text": "In Principles of Programming, we talked about variables. We said these are essentially boxes that store information of a certain type so the program can refer to it later.\nIn many programming languages, we need to create a variable by declaring it. This means specifying its type alongside its name.\nIn Python, things are much more laid back. Variables are dynamic, so we simply assign a value to a name to create the variable, and the type will be automatically set based on the Value we provide. We assign values in Python using the assignment operator =. It basically says “Let this have a value of this”.\nThis can cause confusion if you’re new to coding. = does not mean ‘equals’.\nWhat will be the variable type of each of these variables after assignment? \nBecause variables in Python are dynamic, their type will change if we give it a value of a different type :\n\n\n5.0.1 Dealing with spaces in names\nIn programming languages, a space indicates a separation between instructions, values etc. So if we want to name something (like a variable) with multiple words then we can’t use spaces. There are two principle conventions for how we deal with this :\n\nYou can use whichever you prefer (though ensure you’re consistent) but snake_case is generally preferred for (and recommended by the developers of) Python.\n\n\n5.0.2 Variable Types - Single Items\n\nLet’s remind ourselves of some of the main types of variable, and see what they look like in Python.\n\n5.0.2.1 Numbers\nIntegers (int) are whole numbers Floating point numbers (float) are numbers with up to 15 decimal places\n\n\n\n5.0.2.2 Text\nStrings (str) are sequences of characters denoted using “ or ‘ (Note - Python does not have a separate variable type for characters, they are just strings of length 1)\n\n\n\n5.0.2.3 Truth\nBooleans (bool) take one of two values to indicate whether they are True or False.\n\n\n\n\n5.0.3 Variables that store Multiple Items\n\n\n5.0.3.1 Lists\nLists (list) are sequences of items, where the order matters. Duplicates allowed.\n\n\n\n5.0.3.2 Sets\nSets (set) are unordered sequences of unique items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou won’t come across sets too often in Python - so don’t worry about them too much for now!\n\n\n\n\n5.0.3.3 Tuples\nTuples (tuple) are ordered sequences (like a list) but are immutable (once created, they cannot be changed)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou won’t come across tuples too often in Python - so don’t worry about them too much for now!\n\n\n\n\n5.0.3.4 Dictionaries\nDictionaries (dict) are unordered collections of key-value pairs",

If we tried to reference them outside of the function, we’d get an error (though we can create new variables with the same names, but they are different variables to the ones in the function).\n\nA global variable is one which is defined outside of a function. These can be used and referenced anywhere - all of the Python code can see it. However, if we want to change them inside a function, we have to use something known as the global keyword.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThis is not typically recommended though, and is considered bad practice (and can lead to problems, as you can likely imagine), so we won’t teach it here.",

And each one adds another dimension to our problem.\nSo we need a solution that allows us to work with multi-dimensional arrays easily and efficiently.

This means that you can only store the same type of data (e.g. floats, integers etc) across the array.\nThe dimensions of a NumPy array must also be the same length consistently across the array (but can differ across dimensions).\nFor example, we can have an array which represents 3 departments, with 4 groups in each, and 10 people in each group. But we can’t have more or fewer than 10 people in each group, or more or fewer than 4 groups in each department. For real world data, this means we will sometimes have 0 or missing data for some values, and we deal with that differently depending on what we’re trying to represent.\nTo hammer this home, the below is NOT valid (but NumPy will let you do it, it’s just it won’t work as you think - you’ll end up with a 1D array with two values which are references to two lists) :",

    "text": "32.2 Creating a new dataframe\nWe have two choices when we want to create a new Pandas DataFrame :\n\nWe can create a new DataFrame and then build the DataFrame manually\nWe can read in existing data from a .csv file\n\nGiven that 99% of the time you’ll be doing the latter for real world applications, let’s just focus on that. And it’s also really easy!\nPandas has a fantastic function that allows us to read in data from a .csv file, and it will automatically stuff it into a new DataFrame for us!\nIn one line of code!!\nDon’t believe me? Observe…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nOne fantastic feature of pandas is that we can point to either a local file (one stored on our machine) or a remote file (one stored somewhere else - like the web).\n\n\nIn the example below, we are accessing a file called input_data.csv.\nIf this file was stored in the same folder as our python file, we would just do\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"input_data.csv\")\n\nWe can then show the first 5 rows of the data with the .head() method.\n\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatient ID\nName\nFlu Vaccine\nAge\nCounty\n\n\n\n\n0\n65192\nBob\nYes\n42\nCornwall\n\n\n1\n84568\nNigel\nNo\n27\nDevon\n\n\n2\n93765\nFlorence\nYes\n84\nSomerset\n\n\n3\n97865\nMartha\nYes\n57\nSomerset\n\n\n4\n12451\nSimon\nNo\n35\nSomerset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, we could also use a web location. We’re going to use this method in the rest of the examples to allow us to interact with pandas dataframes in this book.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can see that the outputs are identical!",

    "text": "32.4 Specifying an existing column as the index\nIn our data, we already have a unique identifier in our data - “Patient ID”. When we read in the .csv, we can tell Pandas that we want to set this column to be the Index (rather than creating a new one).\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIMPORTANT - Pandas will check that the column you specify does truly have unique values. If it doesn’t, it will raise an exception (error) and if you don’t catch it, the code will terminate.\nBe careful when importing data where multiple records refer to the same patient - patient ID would not be a unique identifier in that case.",
