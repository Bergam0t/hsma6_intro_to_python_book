It is now the most widely used language in the world.\nA key feature of Python is that it is highly extensible. This means we can bring in code that others have written to extend the core functionality of Python (we saw that in the last session when we talked about packages).\nPython also allows us to get quick results and build iteratively making it perfect for scientific computing (such as modelling and data science).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYes - it really is named after British comedy troupe Monty Python!",

We said that they are bundles of code that we can run every time we call them. We can give them optional inputs, and may get some outputs.\nTo write text to the screen in Python, we use something known as the print() function. The input (that we put in the brackets) is the thing we want it to write to the screen.\nLet’s try it!\nWe use quotation marks “ to denote a string (ie text - a series of characters).

    "text": "In Principles of Programming, we talked about variables. We said these are essentially boxes that store information of a certain type so the program can refer to it later.\nIn many programming languages, we need to create a variable by declaring it. This means specifying its type alongside its name.\nIn Python, things are much more laid back. Variables are dynamic, so we simply assign a value to a name to create the variable, and the type will be automatically set based on the Value we provide. We assign values in Python using the assignment operator =. It basically says “Let this have a value of this”.\nThis can cause confusion if you’re new to coding. = does not mean ‘equals’.\nWhat will be the variable type of each of these variables after assignment? \nBecause variables in Python are dynamic, their type will change if we give it a value of a different type :\n\n\n5.0.1 Dealing with spaces in names\nIn programming languages, a space indicates a separation between instructions, values etc. So if we want to name something (like a variable) with multiple words then we can’t use spaces. There are two principle conventions for how we deal with this :\n\nYou can use whichever you prefer (though ensure you’re consistent) but snake_case is generally preferred for (and recommended by the developers of) Python.\n\n\n5.0.2 Variable Types - Single Items\nLet’s remind ourselves of some of the main types of variable, and see what they look like in Python.\n\n5.0.2.1 Numbers\nIntegers (int) are whole numbers Floating point numbers (float) are numbers with up to 15 decimal places\n\n\n\n5.0.2.2 Text\nStrings (str) are sequences of characters denoted using “ or ‘ (Note - Python does not have a separate variable type for characters, they are just strings of length 1)\n\n\n\n5.0.2.3 Truth\nBooleans (bool) take one of two values to indicate whether they are True or False.\n\n\n\n\n5.0.3 Variables that store Multiple Items\n\n5.0.3.1 Lists\nLists (list) are sequences of items, where the order matters. Duplicates allowed.\n\n\n\n5.0.3.2 Sets\nSets (set) are unordered sequences of unique items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou won’t come across sets too often in Python - so don’t worry about them too much for now!\n\n\n\n\n5.0.3.3 Tuples\nTuples (tuple) are ordered sequences (like a list) but are immutable (once created, they cannot be changed)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou won’t come across tuples too often in Python - so don’t worry about them too much for now!\n\n\n\n\n5.0.3.4 Dictionaries\nDictionaries (dict) are unordered collections of key-value pairs",

    "text": "26.3 File access Modes\nThere are a huge number of different file access modes. The most common ones you will use are :\n“r” - open the file read-only, start at the beginning of the file\n“w” - open the file write-only, start at the beginning of the file\n“w+” - open the file read and write, start at the beginning of the file\n“a” - open the file in append mode (a write mode that starts at the end of the file)\n“w”, “w+” and “a” will create a new file with the given name if one does not exist. “r” will throw up an error if the file does not exist.\nIMPORTANT - if you want to add to a file, you MUST use append mode. If you use a write mode, it will start at the beginning, and therefore wipe out your file before it starts.",
