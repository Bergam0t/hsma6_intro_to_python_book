## Sololearn

There is a course on Sololearn called ['Introduction to Python'](https://www.sololearn.com/en/learn/courses/python-introduction)

This has some interactive code exercises that build up more gradually.
You do have to sign up for a free account - but you don't need to sign up for the pro trial or a pro account to access 90% of that particular course.

There is also an app version of this site for your phone/tablet so you can fit in practice on the go or whenever you have a spare moment.
