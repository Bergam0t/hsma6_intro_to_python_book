# Exercise

## Coding Challenge

So far, you’ve learned the following Python concepts :
= Printing to the display
- Variables and casting
- User inputs
- Comments
- Mathematical operators
- Conditional Logic
- For and While Loops
- Working with Lists and List Comprehension
- Dictionaries
- Libraries / Packages and Imports
- The Random Library

Your task now is to design and build a computer program that uses some or all of the concepts you’ve learned about today.

Your program can do anything you like - be as creative as possible!
