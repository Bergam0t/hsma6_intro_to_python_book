This notebook comes with some additional features allowing you to get a hint or the solution to each exercise without leaving the notebook!

You can query the answer or an hint with `hint(n)` or `answer(n)` for n question number.

So, for example, `hint(15)` would give you a hint for question 15.

Don't feel like you have to do every question in this notebook!

Just try a few of the ones rated 1 star out of 3 (the easiest difficulty) and see how you get on, skipping any you are unsure about or you don't think we have covered in this book.

If you are feeling confident, you can put your Googling skills to the test to try to complete more...
