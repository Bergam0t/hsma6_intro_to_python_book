# Exercise - Putting it all together

## Are you Smarter than (Dan as) a 4 year old?

When I was 4 years old, I wrote my very first program in BASIC on my Atari 800XL.

In it, the computer randomly picked a whole number between 1 and 100, and the user had 10 chances to guess the number.

Every time the user guessed a number, they would be told either that the number was “too low”, “too high” or “correct”.

If the user used up all 10 chances without guessing correctly, they were told “you lose”, along with what the number was, and the game would end.

You’ve been taught enough to write this program in Python.  You should write the game above along with the following features that 4-year old Dan didn’t implement :

- a score, which starts at 1000 and which reduces by 100 for every unsuccessful guess,
and which is displayed if the user wins
- the user’s guesses are stored in a list and printed once the game is over
- the game asks if the player wants to play again after every game ends
- after each game, the player’s score is checked against the current high-score (default is 0) and if the last score is higher than the recorded high score then this replaces the high score.

You could also add some bells and whistles of your choosing!
